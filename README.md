## 📖 Overview

In a corrupted digital world known as **Kernel-9**, reality is breaking apart after a catastrophic system failure triggered by the **Delete Virus**.

You play as a rogue user-script — an unauthorized process trapped inside the system — with no weapons, no permissions, and only one advantage: the **system clipboard**.

In this world, keyboard shortcuts are not inputs — they are powers.

Survive, manipulate corrupted logic, and recover the lost components of the **Master Shortcut** before reality is fully erased.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

Inside the digital sector of Kernel-9, the Master Shortcut has been shattered by the Delete virus, corrupting reality itself.

Players control a rogue user-script capable of:
- copying enemies and objects
- pasting cloned entities into the world
- saving world states
- switching between dimensions

Objective: reconstruct the lost **Master Shortcut (C, V, S, Tab)** before system deletion completes.

## ⚙️ Core Mechanics

| Key | Mechanic | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `C` | Copy Strike | Clone projectiles, objects, and enemies into the clipboard |
| `V` | Paste Summon | Spawn copied entities back into the world |
| `Z` | Undo | Remove the oldest active paste and recover RAM |
| `S` | World Save | Save the current world state as a checkpoint |
| `Tab` | Dimension Switch | Swap between corrupted and clean dimensions |

## 🧠 System Mechanics

### The Tether (`CTRL` System)
CTRL follows the player dynamically. Losing connection triggers chaos effects such as:
- gravity may invert
- controls may scramble
- physics becomes unstable
- chaos events are triggered

## 🕹️ Controls

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `A` / `D` | Move |
| `Space` | Jump |
| `C` | Copy Strike |
| `V` | Paste Summon |
| `Z` | Undo / Free RAM |
| `S` | World Save |
| `Tab` | Dimension Switch |
| `Q` / `E`| Cycle Clipboard Slot |
